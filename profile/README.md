## Hi there 👋
This is a GitHub organization I am currently building and re-organizing some of my projects under.

As the name implies, this is for things I find novel and enteratining (neat) that I write.  There may or may not be much here, it all depends on what I want to write and when.

The organization profile photo is from [Glass and Checkerboard](https://www.nga.gov/artworks/166491-glass-and-checkerboard) by Juan Gris, which is available in the public domain and licensed under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/).  It's one of those things I find neat.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
